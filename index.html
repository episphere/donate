Many cohort studies require mechanisms for data donation. 
Typical examples are the donation of consumer genomics and wearable sensor data. 
</p>
<p>
It is however not reasonable to expect the participant to have the computational skills to handle the data extraction and submission.
Instead, the data donnation should be integrated in the cohort Web Application such that the data can be retireved by engaging the consumer-facing APIs on behalf of the participant.
</p>
<p>
This way, the donation is reduced to the simple action of a cohort participant clicking on a button saying "donate", most likely from a personal mobile device.
This project explores what could be a Minimal infrastructure for data donation using the modern Web Stack.
